# Week 4, Make Blinky

> On your final project board, make blinky for yourself. Then add a button to turn the LED on and off. Bonus points for making the button cause an interrupt. Triple bonus points for debouncing the button signal.

## Questions

> What are the hardware registers that cause the LED to turn on and off? (From the processor manual, donâ€™t worry about initialization.)

> What are the button registers that you read?

> Can you read that memory directly and see the button change in a debugger or by printing out the associated memory?
