# Week 9, multiple different implementations

> In Quiz 1, multiple different implementations for bit reversal were
> given and you were asked to consider the algorithms with respect to
> speed, RAM, and code space. (You can see the code at Godbolt.)
>
> Choose a small algorithm to implement in different ways. Describe
> when/why you might use each. You can choose any small algorithm.
>
> Some possible options include:
>
> - How many bits are one in a given 32-bit uint?
> - How many leading zeros are in a 32-bit uint?
> - Trigonometry functions like sin, cos, tan
> - Integer division with remainder
> - Find the first 100 prime numbers
