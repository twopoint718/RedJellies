# Imaginary Embedded System: Muralbot

*Prompt:* Invent an Imaginary Embedded System

> Tell us about an embedded system that does not exist. It can be grandiose or
> strange; it can be something just one step beyond what you have around you.
> Ideally it is something you personally want to build (even if physics doesnâ€™t
> allow it). What is it? What does it do? What general components do you need?

## Summary

The muralbot is a small device that acts as a self-driving plotter on a wall.
It is able to adhere to many kinds of surfaces using its sticky wheels while
still allowing for freedom of movement, even on vertical surfaces.

The main components are:

- Spray can or marker for drawing
- Motors to drive the wheels
- A solenoid to raise & lower the marker
- Bluetooth to receieve drawing information
