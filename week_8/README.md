# Week 8, Heap, Stack, and Globals

> Compile your project code so it prints out the heap pointer and the
> stack pointer. Print out a global variable address. If you can find
> it, modify your linker file to swap your uninitialized variables and
> initialized variables. Verify it is as expected in the memory
> map. See how that changes your code output.
