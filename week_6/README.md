# Week 6: preliminary rough draft

## Instructions

> Review the final project instructions. Put together a preliminary rough draft of your final report.
> This is intended to be a planning exercise, not that you should have your project complete
> (though it makes the report easier to write if you put it in present/past tense instead of putting in
> “should” and “shall”).
> As you work through the draft final report, note where you might have trouble. Make a list of the
> tasks you want to complete for the project. Make a list of the minimum viable project and any
> blocking items (unacquired hardware, difficulty with toolchains).
> Include any relevant pieces from past assignments (such as the state machine documentation
> from Exercise 5).
> Turn in your document or a link to a github document before 9am on Saturday, January 15.
